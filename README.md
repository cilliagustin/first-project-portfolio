## Introduction
This website consists in my portolio which can be viewed in 5 different versions, each one representing one decade for front end development (from the eighties to the 2020)

### Purpose
#### For the creator
To show all prevous projects created in a fun way that is engaging to the user and to show how a website can radycally change with just a few tweeks

#### For the user (potential employeer)
To see the creatorÂ´s capabilities in case he/she is looking for a new employee

## UX
### Development-Planes
The website consists in a landing page divided in 4 sections:
* Home
* About Me
* My work
* Contact

In the home section is a container with 5 different buttons, this can be pressed and toggle the different versions of the website changing (without refreshing) the website.

### Skeleton
The wireframes were created with the first version (the 2020 version) in mind. The other versions used most of the same structures but had some changes that differ from the original one. The wireframes were drawn using a desktop version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), the key for this aplication was provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/).
