In the home section is a container with 5 different buttons, this can be pressed and toggle the different versions of the website. Changing, without refreshing, the site.

### Skeleton
The wireframes were created with the first version (the 2020 version) in mind. The other versions used most of the same structures but had some changes that differ from the original one. The wireframes were drawn using a desktop version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), the key for this aplication was provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/).

### Design
#### Design description
The design was made with a mobile first aproach. Using flexbox and mediaqueries to create the positioning for mobile and desktop versions.
* The 2020 version is a design created taking inspiration from varios web developer portfolio. the concept is a minimalistic and futuristic aproach of web design. This uses thin lines and a box-shadow to give elements a led effect when necesary.
* The 2010 version is inspired on the 2010 [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) wall. All the information is displayed as if it were Facebook posts with the exception of the profile picture and the buttons for toggeling the versions that in the desktop version are fix positioned to look like asides.
* The 2000 version takes inspiration for the websites used in the beginning of the millennium. The Main title was stylised to look similar to the Microsoft Word´s WordArt. Floats were used so the text can wrap an image and there are plenty of effects (blink, marquee) applied to catch the user´s eye.
* The 1990 version takes it´s aesthetic from Microsoft´s Windows 98 operating system. Many of the elements were stylized to look like they were engraved in the screen and some look like they actually raise. All buttons have an effect when pressed that look like they are being sunken. The Photo displayed has a pixelated effect to intentionally lower the resolution.
* The 1980 version looks like an 80´s terminal. The site aplies a text shadow and is covered by an after pseudo element which apllies a filter that makes the whole screen look like a 1980´s computer monitor. This is the only version that does not use images (since it would interfear with the desired aesthetic) Intead in this cases uses ASCII code art to represent the pictures.

#### Colour
Each version has it´s own color palette that generates enough contrast and provides consistency through all the site, this were created taking inspiration from different sources which will be credited in the credit section.

#### Typography
With the exception of the 2010 version, all fonts were provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* 2020: The section titles and the text next to the icons in the "my Work" section has [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/?query=montserrat) applied as the default font and the rest of the website uses [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/?query=lato) In both cases a backup of Sans-Serif has been applied.
* 2010: This is the only case where only one font is aplied through the hole site, this is [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica)
* 2000: In this case [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/?query=work+sans) was used in all titles, navbar links, buttons and next to the icons in the "my Work" section with a back up of Sans-Serif. The rest of the website uses [Mali](https://fonts.google.com/?query=mali)  with a back up of Cursive.
* 1990: Here [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/?query=vt323) was used for all titles and [DotGothic16](https://fonts.google.com/?query=DotGothic16) for the rest of the site. In both cases a backup of Monospace has been applied.
* 1980: Finally [Press Start 2p](https://fonts.google.com/?query=press+start+2p) was used in all titles, in the text next to icons in the "My Work" section and as header in the portfolio-cards in the "My Work" section. The rest of the site uses [Share Tech Mono](https://fonts.google.com/?query=share+tech+mono). A backup of Monospace has been applied for the whole site.

#### Images
With the exception of my own photos, all images were provided by external sources which will be credited in the corresponding section. Is important to be noticed though that all the images were chosen with the intention to give consistency with the site and the tools which were available in each decade.

### Features
#### Navbar
The navbar has a fixed positioning on the top of the website. In the mobile version it collapses into a hamburger menu, when pressed the hamburger it displays the navegation menu. The desktop version displays the navegation menu normally without the use of a hamburger.

#### Home
The home section consists of the Title, subtitle and introductory text for the website. After this are located the 5 buttons which toggle the different website versions. Noticable changes in other versions:
* 2000: The main title has a background image that acts like a hero image and in the desktop version has the buttons located next to the text intead of under them like in the other versions.
* 2010: This version provides an extra image (profile picture) which in the mobile version is located in the top of the header and in the desktop version is located with a fixed positioning at the left of the website (emulating the profile picture positioning in facebook) the same happens with the buttons that are located to the right the same way Facebook places some extra links or advertising.
