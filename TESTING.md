## Responsiveness
Here are screenshots of the website on the desktop and mobile version. The breakpoint for this is at 768px of width. There is no comparisson provided for the 1980 and 1990 versions since their main structure is very similar to the 2020Â´s one. There are though comparisions provided for the 2000 and 2010 since they structure varies a little bit more from the 2020 version.

## Bugs
* On the 1990 version there was a problem with the inputs in the Form. On [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) the text area has a bigger size than on other browsers and in [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) both text inputs and the textarea did not accept the styling rules.
This was fixed by adding a specific height rule for the text area only on Firefox and the bug with Safari required a "-webkit-appearance none" rule and setting a specific border radius.

## Version Control
During my conversations with my mentor he called to my atention the fact that I was not correctly commiting my updates to the website (I added very few commits with long texts and many changes). After he informed me this and reminded me the correct way to aproach this I quickly changed my way of working but most of the website was with a wrong aproach to commits.
